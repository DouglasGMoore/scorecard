Hi,
This is an web app to make scoring wrestling matches easier. I will be adding the ability to track stats for individual wrestlers and allow for wrestlers to pull up thier stats. Stats to be tracked will be T2, E1, R2, N2, N3, Stalling, Other infractions, pins, wins, and losses.
In the future i hope to be able to add match video saving and replay function.
